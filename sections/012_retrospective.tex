\chapter{Retrospective}
\label{chap:retrospective}

In this section we do a retrospective on the previous chapters by discussing the limitations and the related works published at posteriori.

\section{Uncertainty estimation for independent data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations: feature collapse, reducing the number of hyper-parameters, component analysis.
    \item Other related works: (efficient) ensembles, deep GP, (Partially) Bayesian NN, and single-pass methods, OOD detection approaches.
    \item Status: many works, progress is still possible to improve on desiderata
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations: limited to dirichlet models
    \item Other related works: other works on uncertainty robustness
    \item Status: still unsolved, pretty new topic
\end{itemize}

\section{Uncertainty estimation for dependent data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations: limited to homophilic graphs, benchmarking
    \item Other related works: other works on uncerainty on graphs
    \item Status: still unsolved, pretty new topic
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations: no unceratinty/distribution over time
    \item Other related works: Marin and Oleks works
    \item Status: good progress achieved
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations: limited to small benchmarks, limited to model-free, benchmark
    \item Other related works: other works on uncertainty on graphs
    \item Status: pretty old topic, there is still no clear agreement on desiderata and benchmarks
\end{itemize}
