We introduce a new framework to characterize aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimation in RL with four explicit desiderata, four RL models inspired from SL and a practical evaluation methodology. The desiderata characterize the behavior of uncertainty estimates at both training and testing time. The models combine DQN with sampling-based and sampling-free uncertainty methods in SL 
% without modifications of the RL agents training. 
We give theoretical and empirical evidence that these methods can fulfil the uncertainty desiderata. The evaluation method assesses the quality of uncertainty estimates on sample efficiency, generalization and OOD detection tasks.
