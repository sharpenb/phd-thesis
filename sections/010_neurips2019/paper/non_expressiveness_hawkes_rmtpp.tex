\section{Non Expressiveness of RMTPP intensities}
\label{non_expressiveness_hawkes_rmtpp}

The intensity function has the following form in the RMTPP model \cite{RMTPP}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\log \lambda_0(\Timestamp) = \bm v^T\cdot \bm h_\IndexEvent + w(\Timestamp-\Timestamp_\IndexEvent) + b
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 The variables  $\bm v$, $w$ and $b$ are learned parameters and $\bm h_\IndexEvent$ is given by the hidden state of an RNN.  The only dependence on $\Timestamp$ is $(\Timestamp-\Timestamp_\IndexEvent)$. RMTPP is then limited to monotonic intensity functions with respect to time.
