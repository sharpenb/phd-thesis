\section{Broader Impact}

\section{Open Questions}

2/3 sentences per points

\begin{itemize}
\item Uncertainty Estimation for Robustness, Graphs (e.g. molecules), and RL is still unsolved.
\item Scale Uncertainty Estimation on large data like LLM. It requires much compute.
\item Uncertainty Estimation for Active/Online Learning (How to collect data from uncertainty estimates? How to safely continually learn with uncertainty estimates?).
\item Uncertainty Estimation and Interpretability (Why is the model unsure?).
\item Uncertainty Estimation and Causality (How does a cause reduce uncertainty? How certain are we about learned causal relationships?).
\end{itemize}
