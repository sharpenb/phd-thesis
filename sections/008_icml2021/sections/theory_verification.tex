%\subsection{How robust is uncertainty estimation according to randomized smoothing based verification? \ak{shorter question}}

%Robustness properties of neural networks can either be analyzed by attacks that prove non-robustness or by verification techniques that show robustness. We use randomized smoothing (as proposed by \cite{cohen2019}) to verify robustness around id-data as well as ood-data. To this end, we transform distinguishing between id-data and ood-data based on an uncertainty measure~$m$ into a binary classification problem. In order to obtain a decision boundary, we set a threshold~$\theta_m$ for measure~$m$ such that all inputs~$x$ of the validation data set with $m (x) \geq \theta_m$ are classified as ood (or id, depending on measure~$m$) and id (or ood) else. 
%The randomized smoothing framework is wrapped around this binary classifier and used to verify robustness around id-samples and ood-samples.
