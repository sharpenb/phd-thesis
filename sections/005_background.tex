\begin{itemize}
\item Desiderata: Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty (and all their other names), uncertain when it does not know, efficient, architecture-agnostic, robustness.
\item Models: Sampling-based (Ensemble, DropOut, BNN) vs Sampling-free (GP, Posterior, Conformal). 
\item Evaluations: Calibration, OOD detection, OOD generalization, Shifts, Benchmarks.
