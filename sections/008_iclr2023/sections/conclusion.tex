\section{Conclusion}
%\label{sec:conclusion_008}

We investigate important design choice in DUMs. We show that \emph{training} of DUMs can be improved by decoupling the the optimization of the core architecture and the uncertainty head. We show that expressive core \emph{architecture} can improve DUMs performances. In contrast, additional constraints to avoid feature collapse do not consistently lead to better performance, potentially degrading the OOD generalization and detection trade-off. Finally, we show that the choice of \emph{prior} for DUMs does not lead to important performance improvements.
